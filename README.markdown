Anil's emacs config
================

It is compatible with Emacs 23. Emacs ftw.
(The structure of emacs config is inspired by defunkt's emacs config)


Usage
=====

- Symlink ~/.emacs  to emacs.el
- Symlink ~/.emacs.d/ to emacs directory
- You need to populate local.el in emacs directory to save your local 
settings
